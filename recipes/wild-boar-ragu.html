        This slow-cooked stew of wild boar with juniper berries and black olives is great served with freshly cooked pappardelle pasta and shavings of parmesan.

        Ingredients
    </p>
    </p>
    <p>
    <ul class="l">
        <li>700g/1lb 9oz boneless wild boar shoulder</li>
        <li>4-5 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
        <li>4 rashers rindless smoked streaky bacon or pancetta, cut into 1cm/½in slices</li>
        <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="title">Steps
    </p>
    <p>
    <ol class="l">
        <li>
            Cut the boar into chunky pieces, each around 2.5cm/1in. Trim off any really hard fat or sinew as you go. Season the meat really well with salt and pepper. Heat two tablespoons of the oil in a large frying pan.
        </li>
        <li>Fry the boar in two batches over a medium-high heat until nicely browned on all sides, turning every now and then and adding more oil if necessary. As soon as the boar is browned, transfer to a large flameproof casserole or large saucepan.</li>
        <li>MPour a little more oil into the pan in which the boar was browned and fry the bacon for 2-3 minutes, or until the fat crisps and browns. Scatter over the meat. Add a touch more oil to the frying pan and fry the chopped onion over a low heat for five minutes, stirring often until beginning to soften.</li>
    </ol>
